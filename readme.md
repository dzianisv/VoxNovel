## Overview

VoxNovel is an innovative program that leverages the capabilities of booknlp to analyze literature, attribute quotations to specific characters, and generate a tailored audiobook where each character has a distinct voice through coqui tts. This not only provides an immersive audiobook experience but also brings each character to life with a unique voice, making the listening experience much more engaging.

.epub, .pdf, .mobi, .txt, .html, .rtf, .chm, .lit, .pdb, .fb2, .odt, .cbr, .cbz, .prc, .lrf, .pml, .snb, .cbc, .rb, and .tcr,
(Best results are from using epub or mobi for auto chapter detection)

### Included TTS Models
All Coqui TTS models-(Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, Speedy-Speech, Align-TTS, FastPitch, FastSpeech, FastSpeech2, SC-GlowTTS, Capacitron, OverFlow, Neural HMM TTS, Delightful TTS, ⓍTTS, VITS, 🐸 YourTTS, 🐢 Tortoise, 🐶 Bark), and STYLETTS2.

you might have to reset the keys if something goes wrong with that: Resetting all the keys

Remove or reset all the keys installed in your system by removing the /etc/pacman.d/gnupg directory (as root) and by rerunning pacman-key --init followed by pacman-key --populate to re-add the default keys.

<summary> Windows 11 </summary>
Because of BookNLP Windows issues, all of this will be run in WSL (don't worry, it's still easy).

1. In your PowerShell, paste `wsl --install` to install WSL.
2. In your PowerShell, paste `wsl --update --pre-release` to update WSL to a pre-release version, right now the prerelease has all the sound and such working.

3. After you set the username and password, you'll now be able to open WSL as an application. This will allow you to run Ubuntu software. You'll now want to open WSL if you closed it and paste these commands.

   (This will install Calibre for ebook conversion)
   `cd ~`
   `sudo apt update`
   `sudo apt upgrade`
   `sudo apt install calibre`
    `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

   (This will install Miniconda)
Mini conda code was taken from here:https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/
   `mkdir -p ~/miniconda3`
   `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh`
   `bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3`
   `rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh`

   (This will make sure Miniconda is initialized)
   `~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash`
   `~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh`

3. Close out of your current WSL window and reopen it to be able to use Miniconda.

   `conda create --name VoxNovel python=3.10`
   `conda activate VoxNovel`
   `cd ~`
   `git clone https://github.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel.git`
   `cd VoxNovel`
   `pip isntall styletts2`
   `pip install tts==0.21.3`
   `pip install booknlp`
   `pip install -r Ubuntu_requirements.txt`
   `pip install spacy`
   `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
   `sudo apt install espeak-ng`

You can access the files on your WSL Ubuntu in Windows File Explorer by putting this into the address: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\`
</details>


##   To Run the program
`python gui_run.py`

<details>
<summary> To Run the auto program (Don't use temporarily on hold) </summary>
This means all you do is select the book and all the voices will be auto assigned and generated for you.

`python auto_noGui_run.py`
</details>

## Folders

Final_combined_output_audio: This is where all of your chapter audio files will be put in order of chapter num

output_audiobooks: This is where all of your m4b audiobook files will be stored

## Features
- Free and entirely locally run
- Supports all ebook file formats by using calibre
- Can run on CPU or CUDA GPU
- Autoselects a starting estimated voice by pronouns per character
- Supports all models in Coqui TTS and all voices in the models

## Incoming Planned Features
- Ability to change the character for a line if incorrectly attributed by booknlp
- Make it so that all the included voices and models already have their premade own demo voices
- Make it so that the demo audio for the cloned voices is not their reference audio but what their voices sound like generated
- Using whisper transcriptions to cut hallucinations out of generated audio
- adding a low vram checkbox option in gui
